#	This one is a bit crazy.
#   This makefile is responsible for creating the makefile to create the
#   makefiles to create the objects.
#   Confused?
#   It creates target/objectsMakeppfile.mk from
#   scripts/objectsMakeppfile.mk with scripts/objectsMetaMakeppfile.sh
#

CREATE_DIR:=$(shell if [ ! -e target ]; then mkdir -p target; echo "mkdir -p target"; fi)

# This recreates the Makeppfile responsible for building the makefile for building the objects
target/objectsMakeppfile.mk: target/objectsMakeppfile.mk.auto
	# We are checking if they are the same
    @if [ -e ${output} ] && diff --brief ${input} ${output} >/dev/null ; then \
        true; \
    else \
        echo "cp ${input} ${output}"; \
        cp ${input} ${output}; \
    fi

target/objectsMakeppfile.mk.auto: FORCE scripts/objectsMetaMakeppfile.sh scripts/objectsMakeppfile.mk.template
