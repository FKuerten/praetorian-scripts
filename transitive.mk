#	Dependency and library stuff
#
#	This varies based on static and dynamic releases
#
# Input:
#   DEPENDENCIES          this lists only modules of this type they must
#                         be located in ../${NAME} they can be static,
#                         dynamic or objects
#   STATIC_LIBRARIES      these are libraries that must be linked
#                         statically
#   DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES     these are librearis that must be linked
#                         dynamically
#   LIBRARIES             these are libraries that can be linked either
#                         way
#
# The output obviously depends on the type of artifact we produce
# (though for now there is no difference between debug and nodebug
# versions)
#
# For the produced static libraries we need to list all required
# libraries and modules (libraries + headers)
#   TRANSITIVE_STATIC_LIBRARIES     these are the STATIC_LIBRARIES and
#                                   all TRANSITIVE_STATIC_LIBRARIES from
#                                   any dependency
#   TRANSITIVE_DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES    these are the DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES and
#                                   all TRANSITIVE_DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES
#                                   from any dependency
#   TRANSITIVE_LIBRARIES            these are the LIBRARIES and all
#                                   TRANSITIVE_LIBRARIES from any
#                                   dependency
#   TRANSITIVE_INCLUDES             these are our headers and all
#                                   TRANSITIVE_INCLUDES from any
#                                   dependency
